        <h2>My Web Experience</h2>
        <p>
            As an IT professional, I have a total of 5 years of IT Industry experience in the development of applications. My web development journey has been centered around the architecture and functionality that power the web applications and services we interact with daily. My expertise lies in building the behind-the-scenes components that handle data, logic, and server-side operations, ensuring the seamless operation of web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key aspects of my role is creating and maintaining server-side APIs. I have a strong command of programming languages such as Python, Java, Salesforce, which I use to develop APIs that serve as the bridge between the front-end user interface and the backend database. These APIs are designed to efficiently handle data requests, process inputs, and interact with databases, providing the necessary information to render dynamic content on the client-side.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to technical skills, my role as a backend developer often involves collaboration with front-end developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to define project requirements and ensure that the technical architecture aligns with the overall goals of the project. I have experience working in agile development environments and using version control systems like Git to facilitate efficient collaboration and code management.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, my web development experience as a backend developer revolves around creating the robust infrastructure that powers web applications. I thrive on designing efficient, scalable, and secure backend systems that enable seamless user experiences and contribute to the success of web-based projects.
